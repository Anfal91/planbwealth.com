                <p class="mb-5">A Systematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP) is a facility offered by Mutual Fund, which allows an
                    investor to periodically withdraw fixed money as per requirement instead of withdrawing it in one
                    go. Withdrawals through SWP are subject to exit load and tax implications.
