                                investments without liquidating them and having to book profits or losses in an
                                unplanned manner. All you have to do is pledge your mutual funds, equity shares, bonds
                                or securities and get access to instant liquidity.
                                Unplanned redemptions / sales of investments not only get impacted by unfavourable
                                market prices (since the timing of exit is not planned) but also generally result in
                                upfront tax liabilities, all of which end up causing financial losses to investors and
                                impacting the Goal based investments that the investor may be looking forward to make.

                                way of availing finance against securities held in your NJ E-wealth account, while still

                                continuously brought down.
