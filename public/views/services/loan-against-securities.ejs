                            <p>With Loan Against Securities (LAS) from NJ Capital you can unlock the potential of your
                                investments without liquidating them and having to book profits or losses in an
                                unplanned manner. All you have to do is pledge your mutual funds, equity shares, bonds
                                or securities and get access to instant liquidity.
                                Unplanned redemptions / sales of investments not only get impacted by unfavourable
                                market prices (since the timing of exit is not planned) but also generally result in
                                upfront tax liabilities, all of which end up causing financial losses to investors and
                                impacting the Goal based investments that the investor may be looking forward to make.
                                The LAS - Term Loan product introduced by NJ Capital provides a very quick, convenient
                                way of availing finance against securities held in your NJ E-wealth account, while still
                                retaining ownership and riding the upside of being invested in the stock market.
                                The EMI based repayment structure also ensures that payments are made in an orderly,
                                planned and affordable manner over the specified period and the liability is
                                continuously brought down.
