                            <h3>What is Mutual fund?</h3>
                            <p>Mutual funds can be a good opportunity for small or individual investors to benefit from
                                a professionally managed investment portfolio.

                                They usually invest in a large number of securities, and their performance is tracked as
                                the change in the market cap of the fund, which itself is determined by the performance
                                of the underlying investments.

                                Mutual funds charge a sales commission, known as load, as well as management fees
                                related to the fundâ€™s administration. While all funds charge management or
                                administration fees, there are funds in the market that are no-load, meaning they do not
                                charge a sales commission. The returns of a mutual fund are based on the performance of
                                its constituents.</p>
