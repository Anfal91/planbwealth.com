                                <p style="opacity: 0;">Mutual funds can be a good opportunity for small or individual
                                    investors to benefit
                                    from
                                    a professionally managed investment portfolio.

                                    They usually invest in a large number of securities, and their performance is
                                    tracked as
                                    the change in the market cap of the fund, which itself is determined by the
                                    performance
                                    of the underlying investments.

                                    Mutual funds charge a sales commission, known as load, as well as management fees
                                    related to the fund’s administration. While all funds charge management or
                                    administration fees, there are funds in the market that are no-load, meaning they do
                                    not
                                    charge a sales commission. The returns of a mutual fund are based on the performance
                                    of
                                    its constituents.</p>
